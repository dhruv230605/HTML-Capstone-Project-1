<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A career at the nexus of my two passions, sports and analytics, 
    aligns with my goals and interests. While studying at IIITD, 
    I aim to develop targeted competencies, both technical and 
    interpersonal. I want to collaborate with like-minded students 
    and have opportunities for industry interaction. This will set 
    the foundation for me to develop a powerful network within my 
    field and, eventually, become a recognized leader.</p>
